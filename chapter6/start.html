How Website Works  
1️ User Requests a Page  

The browser sends a request to a DNS server to convert the domain (www.example.com) into an IP address.  

2️ Server Processes the Request  

The request reaches the web server, which locates the requested HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.  
If the page needs data, the server may also interact with a database.  

3️ Files are Sent to the Browser  

The server sends the required files back to the user's browser.  

4️ The Browser Processes the Files  

The browser reads HTML first, then applies CSS, and finally executes JavaScript.  
It constructs a DOM Tree and CSSOM Tree for rendering.  

5️ Final Rendering on Screen  

The browser paints pixels on the screen based on the computed styles and layout.
